"""Point-in-time S&P 500 membership, and an honest accounting of survivorship bias.

Why this module exists
----------------------
``data_ingestion.fetch_sp500_tickers()`` scrapes the S&P 500 constituent list
from Wikipedia *as it looks today*, and the cross-sectional pipeline then pulls
ten years of history for those names. That is the textbook survivorship-bias
backtest bug, and it is not small here: comparing the index membership as of
2016-08 against 2026-08, **175 of the 505 names then in the index (34.7%) are
no longer in it**. Companies leave the S&P 500 by going bankrupt, collapsing to
a small-cap, or being acquired -- so the names silently dropped are heavily
skewed toward the losers. Ranking the *survivors* against each other and
calling the result an out-of-sample edge quietly assumes you knew in 2016 which
firms would still exist in 2026.

There is a second, opposite bias in the same line of code, easy to miss because
it points the other way: a company that only joined the index in 2024 still has
its 2016-2023 history pulled and fed into the cross-section for those years,
even though it was not an index member then. Stocks get *added* to the S&P 500
after a strong run, so their pre-inclusion history is selected on past
performance too.

What this module can and cannot fix
-----------------------------------
It reconstructs membership as of any past date from the Wikipedia page's own
revision history (free, no API key, and reproducible -- each answer is pinned
to a specific revision id), which fixes the *look-ahead inclusion* bias
completely: a ticker is only allowed into the cross-section on dates it was
genuinely an index member.

It **cannot** fully fix survivorship, and this module does not pretend to.
Yahoo Finance does not serve price history for most delisted tickers -- of a
spot check of eleven names removed from the index since 2016 (CHK, SIVB, FRC,
ANTM, CTXS, ATVI, XLNX, CELG, ABC, ...), nine return no data at all. The bias
is therefore *bounded and reported* rather than eliminated:
:func:`coverage_report` states outright what fraction of true point-in-time
members the price data is missing, so the backtest's headline numbers carry
their own caveat instead of being silently optimistic.

It also fixes a trap that appears the moment you try to fix survivorship
naively. Simply adding the removed tickers to the download list is *worse* than
leaving them out, because **exchanges recycle ticker symbols**. ``BBBY`` was
Bed Bath & Beyond, an index member until 2022; it went bankrupt in 2023, and
Yahoo now serves data for that symbol starting 2026-07-17 -- a completely
unrelated company. Pulling "BBBY" for a 2016-2022 backtest and getting 2026
prices for a different firm is a silent data-integrity failure.
:func:`drop_recycled_tickers` catches exactly this by requiring a ticker's
price history to actually overlap the window in which it was an index member.
